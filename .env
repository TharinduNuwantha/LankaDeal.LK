## **Summary of Updates:**

### **New Files Created:**

1. **`myapp/src/services/geminiService.js`**
   - Handles Gemini AI API integration
   - Builds smart prompts with product context
   - Searches related products from database (max 10)
   - Formats product data for AI

2. **`myapp/src/services/localResponseGenerator.js`**
   - Generates responses locally without API calls
   - Handles: price comparisons, comparisons, totals, stock, delivery, discounts, recommendations
   - Returns product links for mentions

3. **Updated `myapp/src/Layout/AIChatBot.jsx`**
   - Integrated with both local and AI responses
   - Smart logic: tries local first, uses AI if needed
   - Searches DB for additional context when user has < 3 products
   - Shows clickable product links in bot responses
